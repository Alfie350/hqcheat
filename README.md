I know this is not a great how-to, but this was a 15-min hack project. Feel free to email with questions.

1. Open quicktime
2. File->New Movie Recording
3. Choose your iphone and put the window somewhere convenient
4. Make an application out of the screen grab script and put in dock
5. Open terminal and node index.js
6. Wait for a question and screenshot when the options are shown
7. The terminal will watch new images on the desktop, run OCR and google answers
8. Choose the answer recommended (and/or) use your best judgement
